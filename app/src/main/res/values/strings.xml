    <string name="life4_trials_description">Trials are a new way to participate in LIFE4. Playing a Trial involves playing a predetermined set of 4 songs</string>

    <string name="life4_trials_long_description">LIFE4 Trials are a new way for DDR players to participate in LIFE4 events outside of the core ranking system. We wanted to give players a chance to test their skills and compare their scores without having to complete full folders or grind out a ton of songs. In addition to consistency and stamina, Trials will also test players’ Marvelous Attack (MA) in order to achieve the highest ranks.\n\nEach Trial consists of 4 songs, grouped together by a common theme (title, skillset, etc), which will need to be played together in order in a single set (including extra stage). Trials will vary in difficulty, but the goals required for each will shift, allowing top-tier players to focus on MA on easier Trials to achieve higher rankings, while also letting newer players focus on passing more difficult songs on the more challenging Trials.\n\nPlayers can earn Trial Ranks by achieving a specific set of requirements for each Trial. The requirements for each Trial Rank are roughly aligned with the same skill goals at each respective level of the core LIFE4 ranking system. A Silver Trial Rank may be earned by simply clearing all of the songs in a Trial, for example, but a Cobalt Trial Rank may require the player to PFC every song, or score under a certain amount of total missing EX. (Some of the more difficult Trials may not include lower-tier Trial Ranks as there may not always be a comparable skill level.)\n\nAre you ready to take on the Trials?</string>
