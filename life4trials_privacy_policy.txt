For the purposes of this document, "Application" refers to the downloadable Android executable LIFE4 Trials, and User refers to the person, organization, or other entity that downloaded the Application.

The Application only uses user data and information explicitly provided to it by the User. This includes:
	- Photos or screenshots taken for the purpose of participating in events provided by LIFE4 and served through the Application.
	- Text transliterations, provided by the user, of computable details like scores from the photos in the previous point.
	- Rankings, verified by the user, awarded to the user based on result data provided by the previous two points.

The Application will optionally allow The User to store two pieces of potentially identifying information, specifically The User's Twitter username and DanceDanceRevolution Rival Code. This information is set in The Application's settings menu and does not pull from external sources. This information is not verified or processed in any way by The Application.  If supplied, these details are displayed to the user by means of an Android system notification shown when navigating to the LIFE4 Submission page.

The User will never be prompted to enter their real name, age, location, or any other personal information of this nature, with the exception of the details outlined in the previous clause.
