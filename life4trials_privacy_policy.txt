For the purposes of this document, "Application" refers to the downloadable Android executable LIFE4 Trials, and User refers to the person, organization, or other entity that downloaded the Application.

The Application does not use or store any personally identifying information. The User will never be prompted to enter their name, age, location, or anything else of this nature.

The Application only uses user data and information explicitly provided to it by the User. This includes:
	- Photos or screenshots taken for the purpose of participating in events provided by LIFE4 and served through the Application.
	- Text transliterations, provided by the user, of computable details like scores from the photos in the previous point.
	- Rankings, verified by the user, awarded to the user based on result data provided by the previous two points.

The Application makes use of Google Drive integration. To this end, the Application:
	- Collects and stores only enough information to authenticate and upload content to the user's personal Google Drive account.
	- Will only initiate Google Drive integration at the user's explicit request.
	- Utilizes an application-specific directory on the user's Google Drive account, into which only photos provided by the user during normal operation of the Application will be uploaded.
